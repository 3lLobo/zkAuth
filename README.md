# Zero-Knowledge 2-Factor Authentication üóùÔ∏è (zk-2FA)

The goal of this project is to provide 2FA for EVM compatible blockchains.
We follow a parallel approach for a twofold Authentication solution. The first implements the popular and broadly adopted TOTP 2FA with a trusted validator. The second solution implements a password-generator based zk proof, which is validated onChain providing a zero-trust security level.

Further we provide a dapp to facilitate user-interaction with our smrt-contracts. All dapp interactions can likewise be performed manually per console.
