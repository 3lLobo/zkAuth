# This is the bacqend, the smart-contract crib

We proudly present the TotpAuthenticator.
One step closer to zero trust and one step away from web2.
You can now use 2FA authentication for your business contacts your web-applications or even your IOTs without a centralized database storing your keys and authenticating users. The Blocqchain takes over!

## Cyborg Run üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Yarn, remix and hardhat:

```shell
yarn hardhat node

yarn remixd -s . --remix-ide https://remix.ethereum.org

yarn hardhat test
```

## Hashing

How to calculate and submit hash:

convert TOTP (eg. `123456`) to bytes/hex with ethers. Padding left!!!
Then sha256 it and insert `0x` at the start.
That's it, now it should match the sha256 on-chain.

## Optimism

A blocqchain with free lunch, I mean, free gas! How could we not choose for Optimism?

Contract TotpAuthenticator deployed to Optimism Goerli:

```bash
0xAdF1c645E2bb8C0057537263db6Ae6ECa7085966
#  Deployment transaction hash
0x846528416731ddd42e37b8f2dc9fbac24aaf105ebe23d53707a680fc99d68ce0
```

Also on Main Goerli bcs Opt Goerli goes not yet get indexed by theGraph:
```bash
0x5E9607EE52286732A5E3A0Fc57dF367bCb8adAa5
# Tx hash
0x561dd2171e2cfe793357143b22632db305434e9a1a3739c3d3fdd44275784356 
```
It's the same address, ain't that funney ü§î
**Update** not the same anymore after debugging the contract and redeploying. Curious if the new contract would again give the same pub address on Optimism.
